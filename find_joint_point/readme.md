Find 

seq1=471 seq2=480

However,

seq1=seq1+(4+7+1) =483

seq1=seq1+(4+8+3) =498

 ....and so on. 

For the seq2 we do the same thing

seq2=seq2+(4+8+0) =492

 ....and so on.

We do that until we find the joining point, in our example the joining point is 519 so the main aim of the function is returning 519. The function has 2 params (seq1,seq2) and returns an integer.
