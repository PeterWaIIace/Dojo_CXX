"Find the Maximum Number of Transactions Before Bank Closure"
Translated Question:

You have a Bank that starts with N money and a list of transactions (both deposits and withdrawals), represented as an array, e.g., [12, 4, 5, -30, 15, 5].

The bank operates with a single account where it deposits and withdraws money. If the balance drops below zero, the bank closes.

However, the bank can choose when to open, meaning it can start processing transactions from any index in the list.

Your task is to determine the maximum number of consecutive transactions the bank can process before it closes due to a negative balance.
