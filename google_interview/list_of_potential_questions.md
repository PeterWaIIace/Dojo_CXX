  ['A','B','C','E'],
  ['S','F','C','S'],
  ['A','D','E','E']
], word = "ABCCED"  
Output: True  
```

---

## **5. Dynamic Programming**  

### **11. Climbing Stairs**  
Find ways to climb a staircase with `n` steps, taking 1 or 2 steps at a time.  

ðŸ“Œ **Example:**  
```python
Input: n = 3  
Output: 3  # (1+1+1, 1+2, 2+1)
```

---

### **12. Longest Increasing Subsequence**  
Find the length of the longest increasing subsequence in an array.  

ðŸ“Œ **Example:**  
```python
Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]  
Output: 4  # [2,3,7,101]  
```

---

## **6. Sorting & Searching**  

### **13. Search in Rotated Sorted Array**  
Find an element in a rotated sorted array in `O(log n)` time.  

ðŸ“Œ **Example:**  
```python
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0  
Output: 4  
```

---
